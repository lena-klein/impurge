Impurge is a GTK3 utility designed to make it easy to rapidly sort images and other files by mapping destinations to keys.

- Work sessions (folders and keys) can be saved to a file for later.
- Click "Session" in the top-left corner, then "Edit" to edit the source folder and preferences.
- Press the + button make a new keybind.

Note: When the app checks the files in the source folder, subfolders are included. Files are only checked when the source folder is changed, so changes to the contents of the source folder will not show.
